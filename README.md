# wheel-speed-calculator

After watching a Java tutorial where the presenter completely butchered the concept of speed and how engines, transmissions and drivelines work, my OCD kicked in
and I had to rebuild their concept of a speed calculator to actually be accurate and work right.

This calculator accepts inputs for the max number of gears in a car's transmission and also accepts tire size (expressed by height in inches) and the final drive ratio in
the differential to complete calculations based off user generated samples of various gear ratios and engine RPM.
The code showcases a Gearbox class, appropriate use of fields, access modifiers and inner classes to streamline fucntionality and offer great readability
